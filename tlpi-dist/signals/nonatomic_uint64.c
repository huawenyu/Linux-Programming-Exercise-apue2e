/* Supplementary program for Chapter 21 */

/* nonatomic_uint64.c

   On x86-32, stores and fetches of a 64-bit integer are not atomic. This
   can result in "memory tearing" on fetches and stores, where the memory
   access requires two bus transactions. Consequently, a fetch of an integer
   that is being modified on another CPU might receive half of the old value
   and half of the new value. Thus, for example, a 64-bit integer can not be
   safely used as the flag variable set by a signal handler and checked by
   the main program.

   This program demonstrates the behavior. The signal handler inverts a
   64-bit integer whose initial value is zero, so that the value constantly
   switches between all bits zero and all bits one. The main program
   repeatedly fetches a copy of that integer and prints out a message
   whenever the fetched value is not all zeros or all ones.

   Compile this program with -m32, and run it:

        $ cc -o nonatomic_uint64 -m32 nonatomic_uint64.c
        $ ./nonatomic_uint64
        Unexpected: ffffffff00000000 (loop 48533)
        Unexpected: ffffffff00000000 (loop 171488)
        Unexpected: 00000000ffffffff (loop 272321)
        Unexpected: 00000000ffffffff (loop 297708)

   On Ubuntu and Debian, you may need to install the package 'gcc-multilib'
   in order to build this program as described above.
